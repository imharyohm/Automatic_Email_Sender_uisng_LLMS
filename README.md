# Custom Email Sender - README

This project allows you to send personalized emails based on data fetched from Google Sheets or a CSV file. It supports email scheduling, throttling, and tracking via **SendGrid**, integrates **Hugging Face** for content generation, and utilizes **Celery** and **Redis** for background task processing. The project is built using **Django** to provide a user-friendly interface.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Django**
- **SendGrid API Key**
- **Google Cloud Project** with OAuth2 credentials for Gmail/Outlook
- **Celery**
- **Redis**
- **Hugging Face API Key**

---

### 1. **Google Sheets Integration**

To send personalized emails using data from Google Sheets, you must integrate the Google Sheets API. Follow the steps below:

#### Step 1: Google Cloud Setup

1. **Create a Project in Google Cloud Console**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and enable both the **Google Sheets API** and the **Google Drive API**.

2. **Create OAuth2 Credentials**:
   - Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
   - Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth 2.0 Client ID**.
   - Select **Desktop App** as the application type and download the credentials as `client_key.json`.
   - This file will be used for authentication to read the data from Google Sheets.

3. **Authenticate Using OAuth2**:
   - To read data from Google Sheets, we use OAuth2 authentication. You’ll need `client_key.json` to authenticate your account.
   - Place the `client_key.json` file in the root directory of your project.

#### Step 2: Accessing Google Sheets Data

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Install the necessary libraries to interact with the Google Sheets API:
   ```bash
   pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
   ```

2. **Authenticate and Fetch Data**:
   - Use the following Python code to authenticate and access Google Sheets data:
   ```python
   from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
   from googleapiclient.discovery import build
   from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError
   import os.path
   import pickle

   SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly']
   creds = None
   if os.path.exists('token.pickle'):
       with open('token.pickle', 'rb') as token:
           creds = pickle.load(token)

   if not creds or not creds.valid:
       if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
           creds.refresh(Request())
       else:
           flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('client_key.json', SCOPES)
           creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)

       with open('token.pickle', 'wb') as token:
           pickle.dump(creds, token)

   service = build('sheets', 'v4', credentials=creds)
   sheet = service.spreadsheets()
   SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID = 'your_google_sheet_id_here'
   SAMPLE_RANGE_NAME = 'Sheet1!A1:D10'
   result = sheet.values().get(spreadsheetId=SAMPLE_SPREADSHEET_ID, range=SAMPLE_RANGE_NAME).execute()
   values = result.get('values', [])
   ```

3. **Map Data to Email Template**:
   - After retrieving the data from Google Sheets, map it to your email template placeholders such as `{Company Name}`, `{Location}`, `{Email}`, etc.

---

### 2. **Email Integration**

This project supports sending emails using **OAuth2** for Gmail or Outlook accounts, or **SendGrid** as the email service provider.

#### Step 1: OAuth2 Integration for Gmail/Outlook

For secure email sending, we use OAuth2 to authenticate users without storing passwords. You'll authenticate using `client_security.json`.

1. **Setup OAuth2 Credentials**:
   - Obtain OAuth2 credentials from the Google Cloud Console (for Gmail) or Microsoft Azure (for Outlook). Download the credentials as `client_security.json`.

2. **OAuth2 Authentication**:
   - Use this file to authenticate users and send emails via Gmail or Outlook:
   ```python
   import smtplib
   from email.mime.text import MIMEText
   from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
   from oauth2client.client import OAuth2WebServerFlow

   flow = OAuth2WebServerFlow(client_id='your-client-id',
                              client_secret='your-client-secret',
                              scope='https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send',
                              redirect_uri='your-redirect-uri')

   credentials = flow.step2_exchange(code)

   server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465)
   server.login(credentials.access_token)
   msg = MIMEMultipart()
   msg['From'] = 'your-email@gmail.com'
   msg['To'] = recipient_email
   msg['Subject'] = 'Subject Here'
   body = 'Hello, {Company Name}!'
   msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'plain'))
   server.sendmail(msg['From'], msg['To'], msg.as_string())
   server.quit()
   ```

#### Step 2: **SendGrid Integration**

1. **Install SendGrid SDK**:
   - To use **SendGrid**, install their Python SDK:
   ```bash
   pip install sendgrid
   ```

2. **Get Your SendGrid API Key**:
   - Create an account on SendGrid, go to the dashboard, and generate an **API key**.

3. **Send Email via SendGrid**:
   - Send an email using the SendGrid API:
   ```python
   import sendgrid
   from sendgrid.helpers.mail import Mail, Email, To, Content

   sg = sendgrid.SendGridAPIClient(api_key='your-sendgrid-api-key')
   from_email = Email("your-email@example.com")
   to_email = To("recipient@example.com")
   subject = "Personalized Email"
   content = Content("text/plain", "Hello, {Company Name}! Here's our offer.")
   mail = Mail(from_email, to_email, subject, content)

   response = sg.send(mail)
   print(response.status_code)
   print(response.body)
   print(response.headers)
   ```

### 3. **Email Scheduling and Throttling**

This section covers how you can schedule emails and throttle their sending rates to meet provider limits.

#### Step 1: **Scheduling Emails**

1. **Allow Users to Schedule Emails**:
   - Provide users the ability to schedule emails for specific times. You can use a date/time picker for scheduling or offer pre-set options like “send all emails at a specific time” or “stagger emails over intervals”.
   
   Example:
   - Send emails at **8 AM every day**.
   - Stagger email sends with **50 emails per hour**.

2. **Storing Scheduled Data**:
   - Store the scheduling data (e.g., scheduled time, email list, etc.) in a database like **Django ORM** or an in-memory solution.

   Example:
   ```python
   from django.db import models

   class ScheduledEmail(models.Model):
       recipient = models.EmailField()
       send_time = models.DateTimeField()
       status = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('Scheduled', 'Scheduled'), ('Sent', 'Sent'), ('Failed', 'Failed')])
   ```

3. **Implementation with Celery**:
   - Use **Celery** to process the email sending task at the specified times:
   ```python
   from celery import shared_task
   from datetime import datetime
   from .models import ScheduledEmail

   @shared_task
   def send_scheduled_email(email_id):
       email = ScheduledEmail.objects.get(id=email_id)
       if email.send_time <= datetime.now():
           send_email(email)
           email.status = 'Sent'
           email.save()
   ```

#### Step 2: **Throttling Email Sends**

1. **Throttle Sending Rate**:
   - Provide options to throttle the rate of emails, such as sending only **X emails per minute** or **per hour** to avoid exceeding API limits.

2. **Throttling with Celery**:
   - Use Celery's rate limit feature to control the sending rate:
   ```python
   @shared_task(rate_limit='50/h')
   def send_email_task(email_record_id):
       email_record = EmailRecord.objects.get(id=email_record_id)
       send_email(email_record)
   ```

---

### 4. **Real-Time Analytics for Sent Emails**

Provide real-time analytics on the email send status to give users insight into their email campaigns.

#### Step 1: **Analytics Dashboard**

1. **Metrics to Track**:
   - Track and display:
     - Total Emails Sent
     - Emails Pending
     - Emails Scheduled
     - Emails Failed
     - Response Rate (if available)

2. **Regularly Update Status**:
   - Use a background job to periodically update the status metrics:
   ```python
   @shared_task
   def update_email_status_metrics():
       total_sent = EmailRecord.objects.filter(status='Sent').count()
       total_pending = EmailRecord.objects.filter(status='Pending').count()
       # Update your analytics dashboard here
  

 ```

---

### 5. **Email Delivery Tracking with ESP Integration**

Integrate with an **Email Service Provider (ESP)** to track email delivery, bounce rates, and opens.

#### Step 1: **SendGrid/Other ESP Integration**

1. **Using SendGrid for Delivery Tracking**:
   - SendGrid provides webhooks for event-based tracking (Delivered, Opened, Bounced).
   - Set up a webhook listener to receive event notifications:
   ```python
   @csrf_exempt
   def sendgrid_webhook(request):
       event_data = request.body
       # Process events here
       process_email_events(event_data)
       return HttpResponse(status=200)
   ```

2. **Tracking Data on the Dashboard**:
   - Update your dashboard with delivery statuses using the tracked data from the ESP.

---

### 6. **Real-Time Dashboard for Email Status and Tracking**

1. **Displaying Email Send Status**:
   - Use widgets or progress bars on the front end to show email sending status (Sent, Scheduled, Pending, Failed).

2. **WebSocket/Real-Time Updates**:
   - Implement WebSocket or polling to ensure that the dashboard updates in real-time as the email statuses change.

---

### 7. **Additional Setup and Configuration**

- **Celery** Setup:
   - Install **Celery** and configure it with **Redis** for task queueing.
   - In `settings.py`, configure Celery with Redis as the broker:
   ```python
   CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
   CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
   ```
